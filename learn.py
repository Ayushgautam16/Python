# relational operator
# <,<=,
# Operator	Description	Example	Output
# ==	Equal to	5 == 5	True
# !=	Not equal to	5 != 3	True
# >	Greater than	7 > 3	True
# <	Less than	4 < 6	True
# >=	Greater than or equal to	8 >= 8	True

# # logical 
# and/ or/ not

# Assignment operator

# Operator	Description	Example	Equivalent To
# =	Assign value	a = 10	a = 10
# +=	Add and assign	a += 5	a = a + 5
# -=	Subtract and assign	a -= 3	a = a - 3
# *=	Multiply and assign	a *= 2	a = a * 2
# /=	Divide and assign	a /= 4	a = a / 4
# //=	Floor divide and assign	a //= 3	a = a // 3
# %=	Modulus and assign	a %= 7	a = a % 7
# **=	Exponentiation and assign	a **= 2	a = a ** 2
# &=	Bitwise AND and assign	a &= 1	a = a & 1
# `	=`	Bitwise OR and assign	`a
# ^=	Bitwise XOR and assign	a ^= 3	a = a ^ 3
# >>=	Right shift and assign	a >>= 2	a = a >> 2
# <<=



# ***********types of operators*******
# Arithmetic Operators:
# These perform mathematical operations: 
# + (Addition) 
# - (Subtraction) 
# * (Multiplication) 
# / (Division) 
# % (Modulo/Remainder) 
# // (Floor Division) 
# ** (Exponentiation) 
# Assignment Operators:
# Used to assign values to variables: 
# = (Assignment) 
# += (Addition and Assignment) 
# -= (Subtraction and Assignment) 
# *= (Multiplication and Assignment) 
# /= (Division and Assignment) 
# %= (Modulo and Assignment) 
# //= (Floor Division and Assignment) 
# **= (Exponentiation and Assignment) 
# Comparison Operators:
# Used to compare values: 
# == (Equal to) 
# != (Not equal to) 
# > (Greater than) 
# < (Less than) 
# >= (Greater than or equal to) 
# <= (Less than or equal to) 
# Logical Operators:
# Used to combine or modify boolean expressions: 
# and (Logical AND) 
# or (Logical OR) 
# not (Logical NOT) 
# Identity Operators:
# Used to check if two objects are the same object in memory: 
# is (Object identity) 
# is not (Not object identity) 
# Membership Operators:
# Used to check if a value is a member of a sequence (like a list, tuple, string): 
# in (Membership) 
# not in (Not membership) 
# Bitwise Operators:
# Used to perform operations on the binary representation of integers: 
# & (AND) 
# | (OR) 
# ^ (XOR) 
# ~ (NOT) 
# << (Left shift) 
# >> (Right shif
